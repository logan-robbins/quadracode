"""
This __init__.py file marks the `agent_registry` directory as a Python package.

It enables the modular organization of the agent registry service, allowing 
for the clean separation of concerns across different modules (e.g., api, 
database, schemas). By treating the directory as a package, it facilitates 
standard Python import mechanisms, making the codebase more maintainable and 
scalable.
